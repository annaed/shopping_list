Dear Gaslight, 

This is my best attempt at the apprenticeship challenge. As you will see as you look at my work, I attempted several different features that are not part of the final app. 

I created the funtions to edit the price and the name of each note. I believe I am missing the component that would make it possible to use both at one time. 

I also attempted to add a button to each note that would add the price of that note to a total at the bottom of the list. I thought shoppers might like this. I ran into trouble however making it functional. I believe my issue was with the definition of 'total'. 

I appreciate any feedback you have for me on my attempt! I hope you enjoy looking at it! I know I have a lot to learn, but I hope you give me the chance to do so. 

Thanks,
Anna
